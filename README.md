# Recon2Neo4j - a graph database for the human metabolic network

The Recon2Neo4j Framework uses the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph platform for the management of data on human metabolism. Specifically, it facilitates i) identification and ii) visualization of subnetworks of interest from the <a href="https://vmh.uni.lu/"> Human Metabolic Reconstruction</a> (Recon2, Thiele et al., Nat Biotech, 2013) by using the powerful neo4j CYPHER query language and neo4j functionality, and iii) export in <a href="http://sbml.org/Main_Page">SBML standard</a> and <a href="http://wiki.cytoscape.org/Cytoscape_User_Manual/Network_Formats">SIF</a> formats in order to be integrated and shared among community using well-estabilished platforms (e.g. <a href="http://www.celldesigner.org/">CellDesigner</a>,  <a href="https://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/">yEd</a>, <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>, <a href="http://www.ndexbio.org/">NDEx</a>).

<!---## How to access the Recon2Neo4j Framework
The Recon2Neo4j Framework can be accessed online <a href="https://diseaseknowledgebase.etriks.org/metabolic/browser/"> here</a>.--->
	
A file with several Cypher query examples for the Recon2Neo4j Framework is available for download <a href="https://github.com/ibalaur/Recon2Neo4j/tree/master/sample%20queries"> here</a>. These queries can be extended to accommodate specific topics of interest. 

### For developers

The Recon2Neo4j Framework is freely available for non-commercial purposes and the java code used for data integration and mapping into the  framework is available <a href="https://github.com/ibalaur/Recon2Neo4j">here</a>.
	
#### Requirements

 - Java 7 
 - Maven (tested with Maven 3.5)

#### Install
